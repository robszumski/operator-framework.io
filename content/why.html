      <h1 class="of-heading of-heading--md">Why use the operator Framework?</h1>
    <p>If you are a community member, builder, consumer of applications, or a user of Kubernetes overall, the Operator Framework offers a number of benefits.</p>

        <h2 class="of-heading of-heading--md">For builders and the community</h2>
        <div class="of-section-page-intro__content__columns">
            <p>Today, there is often a high barrier to entry when it comes to building Kubernetes applications. There are a substantial number of pre-existing dependencies and assumptions, many of which may require experience and technical knowledge. At the same time, application consumers often do not want their services to be siloed across IT footprints with disparate management capabilities (for example, departments with differing tools for auditing, notification, metering, and so on).</p>
        <p>The Operator Framework aims to address these points by helping to bring the expertise and knowledge of the Kubernetes community together in a single project that, when used as a standard application package, can make it easier to build applications for Kubernetes. By sharing this Framework with the community, we hope to enable an ecosystem of builders to more easily create their applications on Kubernetes via a common method and also provide a standardized set of tools to build consistent applications.</p>
        <p>We believe a proper extension mechanism to Kubernetes shouldn’t be built without the community. To this end, Red Hat has proposed a “platform-dev” Special Interest Group that aligns well with the existing Kubebuilder project from Google and we look forward to working with other industry leaders should this group come to fruition.</p>
        <p>“We are working together with Red Hat and the broader Kubernetes community to help enable this ecosystem with an easier way to create and operate their applications on Kubernetes,” said Phillip Wittrock, Software Engineer at Google, Kubernetes community member, and member of the Kubernetes steering committee. “By working together on platform development tools, we strive to make Kubernetes the foundation of choice for container-native apps - no matter where they reside.”</p>

        <h2 class="of-heading of-heading--md">FOR APPLICATION CONSUMERS AND KUBERNETES USERS</h2>
    <p>For consumers of applications across the hybrid cloud, keeping those applications up to date as new versions become available is of supreme importance, both for security reasons and for managing the applications’ lifecycles and other needs. The Operator Framework helps address these user requirements, aiding in the creation of cloud-native applications that are easier to consume, to keep updated, and to secure.</p>

    <p>Operators come in different maturity levels in regards to their lifecycle management  capabilities for the application or workload they deliver. The capability models aims to provide guidance in terminology to express what features users can expect from an operator.</p>
